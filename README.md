# react_native_setup


Foreword: I promise I'm not being low effort by linking so many docs, the documentation for react native is just really, really good and explains it better than I ever could.

You can see two react folder in this repo:
1 - React / ReactApp
2 - React_test

1 is the folder that I made from running the react native command in this repo;
2 is the folder I made from running the react native command IN A DIFFERENT REPO - However, it contains working examples of the react native code I learnt - I copied the entire folder from a different vscode project. I say this because I'm not sure how (if at all) it effects its functionality. However, syntactically I believe the code is correct so use it as a guide.


Installing TypeScript

Follow the below guide until you have successfully printed 'Hello World' on your console. You can stop following the guide once you get to the section on 'IntelliSense'

 Make sure that you are in your HelloWorld file or you will error as your helloworld.ts file cannot be found.

Installing React Native

Follow the below guide to help you set up your React Native application - The expo go app is very helpful because when you refresh your code you can see directly on your phone how the app looks!

https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

------------

After installing react native, I tried to emmulate some of the functionality we had in our FE project - the first thing I did was routes - consider the below documentation to help you with this!

For an example of this, consider the stack.jsx file in react_test/components

https://reactnative.dev/docs/navigation

-----------

After navigation, I learn about how state works in react native - again consider the below documentation

For an example of this, consider the App.tsx file in react_test/App.tsx

https://reactnative.dev/docs/state

Thats about as far as I got - seems super similar to react and yeah that it :)
